**1) Problem Statement:-**

The ad server logs contain valuable information such as browser details, IP addresses, geographic locations, search patterns, site urls, and other relevant data. The objective of the hackathon is to build a robust model that can accurately predict whether a user belongs to the HCP category and its specialization id/taxonomy.

**2) About the Dataset:-**

**2.1)** **Input:-** Ad server logs containing information on user behavior and other features

**2.2)** **Output:-** Given a userid(userplatformuid) and ad server log, classify if the user is an HCP and its specialization (taxonomy).

**2.3)** The input contains the following type of data:

**a)** HCP has been identified but the taxonomy/specialization is not identified - IS_HCP is true but taxonomy is not populated.

**b)** Both HCP and taxonomy/specialization are identified - IS_HCP is true and taxonomy is also populated.

**c)** The remaining rows pertain to data where there is no information about HCP. It may correspond to HCP or may not.

**2.4)** **Data Description:-**

**a)** The data fields are described below:
